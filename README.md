##Brief Introduction😄
Hello and welcome to my page! 👋 My name is Onyinyechi “Onyi” Ajoku. I am a recent graduate of business administration📚 with an interest in technology💻. It should be noted that I have no prior experience with technology and have made it my goal to become an expert in it. With GitHub, I'll be able to hone my abilities and blend my technical and business knowledge to produce incredible things along the way.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Background in Business Administration📚###
Business has always piqued my curiosity, even since I was young. I've always been curious about the abilities and strategies employed by prosperous businesses to attain thier degree of success. Since I was a little child, I have desired to make a significant contribution to the business world, and my curiosity drove me to pursue a degree in business administration. One of the best things about business is that it's a vast field with a wealth of expertise. Accounting, marketing, economics, finance, and commerce are a few of these various components. It lets you apply yourself to a considerable extent and provides you with insight into the various areas. I'm glad I have these abilities since they offer me a significant edge and will help me be adaptable in any career I pursue in the future. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###Transitioning into Tech💻
Since I've demonstrated my happiness and contentment in the business world, I know a lot of people are wondering why I decided to make the transition into technology. This is because I think that developing my technological talents and fusing them with my business acumen will set me apart in the job market and provide me with flexibility. In addition, I've developed a strong interest in technology and a curiosity about how the modern world operates. Modern life is powered by technology in every way. The quality of life is enhanced by technology. It makes things simpler and relieves tension and stress. I'm an inquisitive individual who wants to know everything there is to know. That was my original motivation for standing out: I also want to make a significant contribution to the world in my special way. Technology has, in my opinion, substantially enhanced the corporate environment, and the combination is excellent. Even though I am aware that it will take a lot of time and effort for me to become an expert, I am committed to being a part of it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###Current Learning Journey🏃
🕐Project Management##: Project management was the first course I took on Udemy. It taught me a lot of things. It gave me a lot of insight into how to better organize tasks at work, particularly when utilizing a Gantt chart. Although I didn't learn this in the classroom, I will be able to apply it and perform unclear duties flawlessly in the future thanks to the additional information I received from that course. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
💻Python###: I went on to enroll in a Python course right away. I'll admit that at the time, I found this course to be overbearing.  The concepts and methods were somewhat unclear for me as a novice. Despite my achievement in finishing the course and receiving a certificate, there are still many ideas and methods that I find difficult to grasp. At the first hint of trouble, I became terrified and started looking for solutions. I came onto the concept of "personal projects”.  ​​For someone like myself who is just starting, personal projects are the finest approach to improving learning. This way I can move forward and continue to develop as a Python programmer.  I'll be posting my practice attempts here so other programmers may see them and provide feedback. I'm quite receptive to ideas and will be fully committed to this cause. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
😆Excel: I'm taking a Microsoft Excel course right now on Udemy. Not long after finishing my Python course, I started this one. I'm taking this course because I think Excel knowledge is crucial. I'm not aware of this fundamental ability. It will be of tremendous use to me in the future while handling management initiatives as well as in areas such as data analysis, financial analysis, technical sales, etc. An increasing amount of areas demand proficiency with Excel, and I'm glad I'm learning it. It's inevitable for a beginner to encounter difficulties. Many ideas are difficult for me to understand, so I've created a checklist of the ones I find difficult to tackle along the road. I'll also post some of my failed attempts at using Excel here for comments. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###What I’ve learned so far👓###
❤️Patience and resilience are the two most valuable lessons I have learned thus far on this journey.  Deciding to set out on an unfamiliar journey is not simple. At first, I was nervous and avoided making the choice repeatedly. Later, I concluded that the emotion was just a part of it and that this was an investment that would pay off for me in the years to come. As someone who always aims to be the best they can be, I found the conclusion to be rather familiar. Self-improvement is always a wonderful idea. Throughout my learning process, I have encountered difficulties with a variety of ideas and approaches, but I have decided to persevere. I often feel overpowered, but I always stop, take a break, and keep going. I've accepted the path and am aware that perseverance and patience are crucial qualities that will help me get through it and achieve flawless outcomes in the process. 


Additionally, this approach has taught me to be open and honest. Given that I was still a beginner, I had extreme anxiety and felt under tremendous pressure to develop my abilities before putting myself out there, but perfection is a myth. Should I pretend to be someone I'm not to learn from my mistakes? How will those who are more skilled than me get in touch with me to share advice and pointers that will help me advance? After realizing this, I decided that being transparent was the best course of action, which is why I have decided to accurately and completely document my journey.


##What I plan to work on👷
This is an outline of skills that I plan to acquire in the upcoming months. I will use this as a guide as I learn, and I am completely aware that things take time. I have no intention of rushing the process. As time goes on, it will also be updated and modified.
